## üõéÔ∏è How to use?

1. Install kubernetes and create a cluster. 
2. Create pods using the files api_pod.yaml and streamlit/streamlit_pod.yaml
3. Create services using the files streamlit/service.yaml and service.yaml
4. Run the services using
   ```
   minikube service streamlit-service
   minikube service fastapi-service
   ```
You may have to run the 2 lines in 2 separate instances of the CLI.

## Enhancements
1. Find a free way to delploy this kubernetes cluster globally.
